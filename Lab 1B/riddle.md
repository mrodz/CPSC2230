# The Debugger's Doubloons
A stolen map, a rival's deceit,\
To save our crew from a grim defeat.\
A pirate’s code you must now reveal,\
In perfect order, with skill and zeal.

The five secret keys, you must unmask,\
A truly fearsome, debugging task.

One from our crew, a captain or mate,\
A number of passage to seal your fate.\
A future day's count, a story yet to be,\
And the two bright stars that mark our treasure's final resting place.

Your mission starts when the `main` mast's up,\
And the `arg`s you seek fill the treasure `void`.\
So `arrrrgv` and `arrrrgc` to your might,\
To find the treasure, and win the fight.
