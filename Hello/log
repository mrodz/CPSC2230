I did not discuss my solution with anybody. I helped Ethan Ebizadeh
set up an ssh keychain on his machine. I helped Yanga Booker learn
about strings. The hardest part of this assignment was running the test suite.

DISCUSSION

I had no idea that in order to update the source code file that the test suite builds with a makefile, I had to run:

> /c/cs223/bin/submit 0 hello.c 

I did not feel like this was articulated in the test suite docs, so I was scratching my head going through the Perl files trying to understand why outdated code was being compiled in the makefile. Anyways, once I got this problem debugged, I submitted the assignment! All is well. Brainstorming my “fun” facts took longer than writing the print statement. I used string literal concatenation to make my code prettier.
