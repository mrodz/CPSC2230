2/12  10:48am  0:10  Read assignment, set up ssh to the zoo, copy over
                     files from /c/cs223/hw2/Required
2/12  10:58am  0:05  Fixed linker error in makefile; learned that linking
                     does not include math.h and I must pass the -lm flag
                     to the linking target:

2/12  11:10am  0:55  Implemented command line parsing in cli.c, used opaque pointer
                     design pattern.
2/12  12:10pm  4:00  Implemented file parsing. The name is dynamic and can grow.
                     the amount of locations is dynamic and can grow. Added robust
                     enum-based error system to report user errors. Moved constructors
                     and destructors to NAME_init and NAME_deinit pattern. Passes valgrind:
                     ==1992937== HEAP SUMMARY:
                     ==1992937==     in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
                     ==1992937==   total heap usage: 128 allocs, 128 frees, 12,333 bytes allocated
                     ==1992937== 
                     ==1992937== All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
               ----
               2:25  TOTAL time spent

I did not discuss my solution with anybody. I banged it out in one go after
playing around with building a CLI parsing library (just for fun).
