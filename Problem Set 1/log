1/26   2:00pm  0:15  read assignment, downloaded zip file, set up ssh to
                     the zoo.
1/26   2:15pm  1:00  I played around with making a command-line argument
                     parsing library. Then, I realized I couldn't use it
                     for this assignment anyways because this assignment does
                     not allow for any heap allocations :(
1/27   3:00pm  0:10  extract command line arguments to their correct type
                     by using atoi and assertions to ensure no invariant
                     inputs occur.
1/27   3:10pm  0:30  implemented the life.h interface in life.c
1/28   9:29pm  0:05  added more assertions to main.c to ensure no bad input
                     could occur.

I did not discuss my solution with anybody. I banged it out in one go after
playing around with building a CLI parsing library (just for fun).

DISCUSSION

I've written Conway's game of life in C before as an exercise for a programming
course I took way back in the day. Therefore, this assignment was not very challenging.
Because the actual implementation was not too complex, I will discuss two difficulties I
encountered running/coding the assignment. First, there is an issue with my Visual Studio code
that sometimes means C/C++ Intellisense gets stuck on indexing. This is just annoying when
it comes to type hints and code formatting. I eventually found out that the issue gets fixed
50% if the files that the Intellisense tries to index are in the PWD of the editor's open folder.
I encountered a subtle bug caused by inconsistent #define symbolic constants. The grid dimensions
ROWS and COLS are baked into each compiled object file. I built the project with one set of values,
then built it again using a different set of values without cleaning. Because the makefile is 
rudimentary and doesn't declare dependencies, the final Life executable contained conflicting 
assumptions about ROWS and COLS. This resulted in:

```
*** stack smashing detected ****
Aborted (core dumped)
```

Running `make clean` fixed this, of course.

And that's all! This assignment was a fun refresher to C.
