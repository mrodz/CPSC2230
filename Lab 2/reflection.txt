Reflection Questions (turn in short answers)

What is the biggest limitation of this program’s design?

One of the biggest limitations is the fact that the size of the line of the file AND the number of lines 
in the file is fixed at compile time. That means that the user cannot arbitrarily use our code to parse
large files that do not fit the predefined dimensions. This lack of dynamic memory allocation means our code
is less useful and the program needs to be recompiled EVERY TIME that we want to change the input dimensions.
This also means stack memory could be wasted because, if we make the dimensions too high, but the file input is
small, then we allocate too much stack space. The inverse could also be true and cause problems.

Is defining the struct in the header a good idea?

Yes, it is a good idea to define structs in the header! Defining the struct in the header is a good abstraction 
because it creates an interface to the data, but leaves implementation elsewhere. This separation of concerns is 
good programming design. It's also good practice to define types in header files.
